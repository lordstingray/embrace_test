This repo is just an example test.

There are couple of things that can be done to improve the quality of the code.

- To avoid any exceptions, rescue blocks can be implemented.
- Filters can be added to fetch only relative data, which is optional for us(dev), but it will definitely speed up the processing time.
- Code processing and duplication can be avoided as well.
- Classes and methods can be defined to avoid code readability.
- if, else statement can be updated to when statement for better approach.
- Mapping over arrays present in response can be done by other supported methods as well.
